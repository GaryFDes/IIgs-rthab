ROM 01 Apple IIgs RGBToHDMI Adapter board [Top](pictures/Top%20of%20Board.jpeg)/[Bottom](pictures/Bottom%20of%20Board.jpeg)

[Plug](https://warwickts.com/4405/W9327-68-Way-PLCC-Plug) that I used and bought there.

[Socket](https://app.adam-tech.com/products/download/data_sheet/198229/plcc-68-at-data-sheet.pdf) that I used and bought on [DigiKey](https://www.digikey.com/en/products/detail/adam-tech/PLCC-68-AT/9833042)

This is my fourth revision of this board.  I originally wanted to have the plug and socket on the bottom, and [this connection header](https://www.digikey.com/en/products/detail/te-connectivity-amp-connectors/5103308-3/1114901) on the top.  I found out in the end that I needed to solder the cable right to the header in order to have the height correct.  Also, the plug described above was too tall.  I had to cut down the plug one layer.  There is another [low height connector](https://us.warwickts.com/4391/W9305-68-Way-PLCC-Plug) that is through hold but sold only in bulk.  If I ever get enough gumption and money I will try to redesign the card with that plug in mind.

Steps are:
1) Get all the supplies
2) Get the board(s)
3) Cut down the plug (not an easy task)
4) Surface mount the plug
5) Through hold solder the socket
6) Connect the cable that is long enough to go through the opening on the IIgs.
7) Connect your RGBToHDMI 12 bit connector to the cable (!!DO NOT!! Supply power to the RGBToHDMI.  The IIgs cable already has power on it.)
8) Connect to your HDMI monitor
9) Start up the monitor and the IIgs.
